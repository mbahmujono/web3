### **Smart Contract Design Outline**


#### **Smart Contract Structure**

1. **CowNFT Contract**
   - Represents individual cows.
   - Each NFT contains metadata like:
     - Cow ID
     - Date of birth
     - Milk production data
     - Ownership percentage
   - Supports fractionalization (splitting NFT ownership into fungible tokens).

2. **RevenueSharing Contract**
   - Manages the distribution of milk sales revenue.
   - Integrates with the CowNFT Contract to map revenue to fractional owners.
   - Uses Chainlink Automation for periodic execution of revenue sharing.

3. **Bond-Like CowNFT Contract (Optional)**
   - Acts as a financial instrument offering:
     - Fixed monthly returns (coupon payments).
     - Principal repayment after a predefined period.
   - Includes logic for calculating payouts and managing the repayment schedule.
   - Uses Chainlink Price Feeds for currency stability and payout adjustments.

4. **Marketplace Contract**
   - Facilitates buying, selling, and trading of CowNFTs.
   - Includes auction mechanisms for pricing and sale events.
   - Charges transaction fees for revenue generation.

#### **Key Features of the Smart Contracts**

1. **Fractional Ownership**
   - Implemented via ERC-1155 or ERC-20 fungible tokens linked to each NFT.
   - Allows multiple users to share ownership and revenue.

2. **Automated Revenue Distribution**
   - Smart contract reads milk sales revenue data from Chainlink Oracle.
   - Payouts are distributed to fractional owners based on ownership percentage.

3. **Fixed Returns and Principal Repayment**
   - Use Chainlink Automation to trigger monthly payouts automatically.
   - Contract locks the principal amount in a secure vault for repayment.

4. **Security Measures**
   - Utilize OpenZeppelin libraries for battle-tested ERC standards.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to secure critical functions.
   - Add Circuit Breaker logic to pause contracts in emergencies.

### **Blockchain Technologies**

1. **Chainlink**
   - **Oracles**: Fetch off-chain milk sales data, market prices, and other external inputs.
   - **Automation**: Automate recurring payouts and contract execution.
   - **Price Feeds**: Ensure stable payout calculations using real-time currency exchange rates.

2. **OpenZeppelin**
   - Security and standardization for ERC-721 (NFT), ERC-1155 (multi-token), or ERC-20 (fungible tokens).
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) and upgradable contracts.

3. **Polygon or Ethereum Layer 2**
   - Scalability: Low gas fees for frequent transactions like revenue distribution.
   - Eco-friendliness: Environmentally sustainable compared to Ethereum mainnet.

4. **The Graph**
   - Index and query blockchain data efficiently.
   - Enable a user-friendly dashboard for NFT holders to view their returns, ownership percentage, and payouts.

5. **IPFS or Arweave**
   - Decentralized storage for cow metadata and records (e.g., health and production).

6. **Gnosis Safe**
   - Multi-signature wallet for managing funds securely (e.g., operational and reserve funds).

### **Designing the CowNFT as a Bond**

To make CowNFTs act as bonds with fixed returns:

1. **Principal Lock**
   - Lock the initial investment (e.g., the purchase price of the NFT) in the smart contract vault.

2. **Fixed Monthly Returns**
   - Define a monthly payout rate.
   - Calculate and distribute returns using Chainlink Automation.

3. **Principal Repayment**
   - After a fixed period (e.g., 12 months), release the locked principal to the NFT holder.
   - Optionally, implement vesting to encourage long-term holding.

4. **Early Exit Option**
   - Allow users to sell their fractional ownership or entire NFT on the marketplace before maturity.

---

### **Workflow Example for Bond-Like NFTs**

1. **Investor Purchase**
   - An investor buys a CowNFT (e.g., $1,000).
   - Metadata includes the monthly return rate (e.g., 5%).

2. **Revenue Generation**
   - Milk sales generate $500/month for 12 months.

3. **Monthly Payout**
   - Investor receives $50/month (5% of $1,000) as a fixed return.
   - Revenue surplus (if any) is used to ensure principal safety or reinvestment.

4. **End of Term**
   - After 12 months, the $1,000 principal is returned.
   - NFT is optionally burned or transitioned into a new contract phase.

---

### **Benefits of the Bond-Like NFT Model**
- Attracts a broader audience (investors looking for predictable returns).
- Adds a hybrid investment structure to the project.
- Allows flexibility: traditional revenue-sharing for some NFTs and bond-like structure for others.

### **Workflow Example**

---

#### **Step 1: Company Mints CowNFT**

1. **Pre-Mint Checks**:
   - Smart contract verifies the balance in the **Capital Wallet** to ensure sufficient funds.
   - Fetch the current **Cow Price** using a trusted Chainlink Oracle.

2. **Transfer of Funds**:
   - The required amount (cow price) is transferred from the **Capital Wallet** to the **Cow Purchase Wallet**.

3. **Mint CowNFT**:
   - A CowNFT is minted, containing metadata such as:
     - Unique cow identifier.
     - Cow details (e.g., age, milk production rate, health status).
     - Monthly return rate and bond maturation period.

4. **Marketplace Listing**:
   - The minted CowNFT is transferred to the **Marketplace Wallet**.
   - The CowNFT is listed for sale, allowing investors to purchase the whole NFT or fractionalize it into smaller ownership units.

---

#### **Step 2: Investor Purchases CowNFT**

1. **Purchase Options**:
   - Investors can:
     - Buy the **entire CowNFT** as a single owner.
     - Purchase **fractional ownership** through fungible tokens (e.g., ERC-1155 or ERC-20 tokens linked to the NFT).

2. **Metadata Update**:
   - The purchased CowNFT updates its metadata to include:
     - Ownership details.
     - Monthly return rate.
     - Bond maturation period.

3. **Investor Wallet**:
   - Ownership records are stored on-chain, and fractional tokens (if applicable) are distributed to investor wallets.

---

#### **Step 3: Revenue Distribution**

1. **Revenue Flow**:
   - Milk sales revenue is deposited into the **Company Account** (an operational wallet).

2. **Revenue Proportioning**:
   - Smart contract splits the revenue into predefined categories based on a **DAO-approved budget**:
     - 5% for operational expenses.
     - 10% for salaries.
     - 25% for marketing.
     - 50% for production costs.
     - 10% for retained earnings.
     - 5% for fixed returns to investors.

3. **Retained Earnings**:
   - The retained earnings (10%) are transferred to the **Capital Wallet**, ready to reinvest in new cows or expand operations.

---

#### **Step 4: Investor Receives Milk Tokens**

1. **Milk Token Distribution**:
   - Investors receive **$MILK tokens** as their fixed return based on the return rate.

2. **Token Redemption**:
   - Investors can:
     - Redeem $MILK tokens for stablecoins from the **Return Wallet**.
     - Stake $MILK tokens to earn additional yield, capital gain, or liquidity provider rewards.

3. **Transparency**:
   - All transactions, distributions, and balances are transparently recorded on-chain.

---

#### **Step 5: End of Term (Bond Maturation)**

1. **Cow Price Evaluation**:
   - At the end of the bond term, the **current cow price** is fetched using the Chainlink Oracle.

2. **Principal and Final Value Distribution**:
   - The smart contract calculates the final value:
     - **Principal Amount**: Investors receive their initial investment.
     - **Current Cow Value**: Distributed proportionally to the NFT holders based on their ownership stake.

3. **NFT Lifecycle**:
   - The CowNFT is either:
     - Burned if the cow is sold or retired.
     - Retokenized if a new term is set.

---

### **Technological Considerations**

- **Chainlink Oracles**:
  - For real-time cow price updates and milk revenue tracking.

- **DAO Integration**:
  - Use a decentralized governance framework (e.g., Snapshot) to approve budgets and distribution percentages.

- **Liquidity Pools**:
  - Create liquidity pools for $MILK token redemption or staking, possibly on platforms like Uniswap or Balancer.

- **Yield Farming**:
  - Offer yield farming opportunities for staked $MILK tokens to incentivize liquidity.

- **On-Chain Record Keeping**:
  - Utilize The Graph for querying and displaying transparent data dashboards for investors.

---

### **Key Benefits of This Workflow**

1. **Transparency**:
   - All financial flows and token distributions are visible on-chain.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Investors can redeem or stake their returns for additional benefits.

3. **Sustainability**:
   - Retained earnings enable reinvestment and business growth.

4. **Investability**:
   - Bond-like NFT functionality attracts a broader range of investors.
